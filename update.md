git aLFS:

- You can view all files tracked by Git LFS with the command `git lfs ls-files`¹⁵. This will show you the SHA reference and the file name for each file.
- You can view the contents of a specific file tracked by Git LFS with the command `git lfs cat-file <file>`³. This will download the file from the Git LFS endpoint if needed and print it to standard output.
- You can view your Git LFS usage for storage and bandwidth on GitHub by going to your account settings and clicking on Billing and plans². You can also see your usage by repository by selecting Storage or Bandwidth under Git LFS Data.
- You can use a Git GUI client like GitKraken or Sourcetree that supports Git LFS and shows you which files are tracked by Git LFS with an icon¹⁴. You can also view the diff of such files in these clients.
